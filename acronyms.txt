SU: Current Average Speed
FF: Free Flow Speed
RWS: A list of Roadways
RW: Single RoadWay
FIS: List of Flow Item Elements
FI: Single Flow Item
DE: Text Description of the Road
QD = Queuing direction. '+' or '-'. Note this is the opposite of the travel direction in the fully qualified ID, For example for location 107+03021 the QD would be '-'
LE = Length of the stretch of road. The units are defined in the file header
CF = Current Flow. This element contains details about speed and Jam Factor information for the given flow item.
CN = Confidence, an indication of how the speed was determined. -1.0 road closed. 1.0=100% 0.7-100% Historical Usually a value between .7 and 1.0 "FF" = The free flow speed on this
stretch of road.
JF = The number between 0.0 and 10.0 indicating the expected quality of travel. When there is a road closure, the Jam Factor will be 10. As the number approaches 10.0 the quality of travel is getting worse. -1.0 indicates that a Jam Factor could not be calculated
SP = Speed (based on UNITS) capped by speed limit
SU = Speed (based on UNITS) not capped by speed limit
TY = Type information for the given Location Referencing container. This may be freely defined string



By default, the service uses specific color mappings that match a traffic scale measured in Jam Factors,
where 0 means "free flowing" and 10 means "completely obstructed".
The following table describes the overlay colors, which follow a standard configuration to map Jam Factors to color.

Traffic Flow to Color Mapping
Color	Description
Green	Free flow of traffic: 0 <= JAM_FACTOR < 4
Yellow	Sluggish flow of traffic: 4 <= JAM_FACTOR < 8
Red	Slow flow of traffic: 8 <= JAM_FACTOR < 10
Black	Traffic stopped flowing or road closed: JAM_FACTOR = 10
